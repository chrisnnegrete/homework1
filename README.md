2 Computational Project Deconstructions + JSON Introduction


JSON Introduction:
Here is what I found for the position of the nose, as inducated by the JSON file:
   "x": 412.6946652655945, "y": 192.62720059697853

Computational Projects:
Example 1: Solid State Tesla Coils with MIDI Interface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbLshnfu0wY

Data/Model:
-The physical Tesla Coils
-Solid state circuitry/drivers/transformers
-Physical input devices (keyboards, guitars, computers, etc.)

Render:
-The lightning generated by the Tesla Coils
-Sound generated by the lightning firing at specific frequencies based on the MIDI data

Simulation:
-Not much of a simulation, but the bolts of lightning can take any form based on the surrounding air and environmental conditions. The arcs are unpredictable but can be focused with a "breakout point" on the topload of the tesla coil.

Events:
-Tesla Coil firing / producing sound and lighting

Input:
-Any kind of sound file
-MIDI conversion
-Keyboard, electronic piano, electric instruments, etc.

Example 2: Test Track at Epcot, Walt Disney World, Orlando, FL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBDLPOkqstw
Data/Model: (Video shows complete process from 3:45)
-RFID Cards given to individual riders to "design" their own car
-Language selection
-Vehicle type selection
-Creating the shape of the vehicle by drawing a line between two points
-Optimizing the shape of the vehicle for better performance
-Exploring other shapes
-Sculpting the shape of the car
-Length of the car
-Width of the car
-Power of the car
-Styling of the car

Render:
-All screens displaying the options
-Optimization of the vehicle shape
-Attributes of the car forming the final concept
-Timer counting down
-RFID scanners illuminating
-Simcar ride
-Simcar data displayed on the screens

Simulation:
-The actual ride experience is the same for all riders, however the data displayed for the riders' individual car designs on the screen differ based on performance results. 

Events:
-Scanning RFID Cards engages the program and allows you to begin designing your car
-After designing the cars, the riders move to the next part of the queue where they board the simcars and scan their RFID cards to upload the data to that ride vehicle.
-Results displayed on the screens
-Scanning RFID card a final time to reveal the results of the users' data

Input:
-User scanning the RFID card
-Selecting options and modifiers in
