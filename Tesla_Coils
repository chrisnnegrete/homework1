Computational Projects:
Example 1: Solid State Tesla Coils with MIDI Interface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbLshnfu0wY

Data/Model:
-The physical Tesla Coils
-Solid state circuitry/drivers/transformers
-Physical input devices (keyboards, guitars, computers, etc.)

Render:
-The lightning generated by the Tesla Coils
-Sound generated by the lightning firing at specific frequencies based on the MIDI data

Simulation:
-Not much of a simulation, but the bolts of lightning can take any form based on the surrounding air and environmental conditions. The arcs are unpredictable but can be focused with a "breakout point" on the topload of the tesla coil.

Events:
-Tesla Coil firing / producing sound and lighting

Input:
-Any kind of sound file
-MIDI conversion
-Keyboard, electronic piano, electric instruments, etc.
